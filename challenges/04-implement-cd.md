# Implement Continous Deployment

After Continuous Integration has completed successfully, you should deploy automatically the updated version of the API to your cluster.

You are expected to be able to correlate the changes made in the code with the corresponding release.

## Challenge

By using the tooling that you have selected previously, your challenge is to refer to the flow that you have defined in the second and third challenges and add continuous deployment capabilities to your existing workflow.

## Success Criteria

Your coach will provide you with an update to perform to your application. You will need to be able to demonstrate that you can reference the deployment of this feature with its corresponding work items. Your branch/pull request policy can be used to enforce workflow and gates between CI and CD activities.
