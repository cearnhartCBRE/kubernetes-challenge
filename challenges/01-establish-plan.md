# Establish Your Plan
In order to have a successful strategy, your team needs to have a plan.

*Resist the initial temptation to rush on the keyboard! This is the time to pause and think as a team about your end-to-end deployment process that you would implement in this fictitious company.*

## Challenge
Your challenge is to define the organization of your team and establish a high level view of the workflow that you will implement during the rest of the event to achieve zero downtime deployment.

Based on your knowledge of the application and its architecture, your team must establish the fundamental process to follow to go from code to production. You are expected to focus only on a basic integration and deployment mechanism that takes into consideration the architecture of the application.

Get familiar with the basic building blocks of a successful workflow and be informed that your current plan may change over the course of the event.

This is a good time to think of the following aspects:

- Each API will potentially have a different life-cycle.
- Your process should aim at minimizing the time it takes to deploy a feature into production.
- You want to be able to prioritize your tasks.
- Small changes are easier to deploy.

## Success Criteria

Present to your coach the workflow and initial organization of the team that you have established together, explaining more specifically how you validate one phase before you move to the next one.

Be ready to answer the following questions:

- What aspects of DevOps are you implementing?
- How are you splitting the work amongst the team?
- How do you keep track of your work in progress?
- How will you communicate amongst the team (Verbal, Teams, Slack, HipChat, Skype, etc)?
